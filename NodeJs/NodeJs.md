# Node Js

Node Js is a Javascript Runtime Environment.

## ECMA Script

Ecma Script is a Standard specification for scripting language that runs in the browser.

## Javascript Engine

Javascript Engine that converts javascript code to machine code.

- V8 engine is Chrome browser's Javascript Engine.
- SpiderMonkey is Firefox's Javascript Engine.
- JavaScript Core is Safari's Javascript Engine.
- Chakra is Internet Explorer's Javascript Engine.

### V8

V8 is Google's open source Javascript Engine. V8 can run standalone or be embedded into any C++ application. This enables you to write a program that can run javascript and additional features that you choose to incorporate.

> **Javascript in Node vs Browser**

> In Node we control the environment. We have access to filesystem and other apis provided by node, but we don't have access to the DOM.
> In Browser we do not control the environment and we have access to the DOM but we don't have access to apis provided by node.
