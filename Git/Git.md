# Git

Git is a version control tool.

**Version Control**

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.

# Getting a Repository

## init
**`git init`** creates an empty git repository in the current working directory. `git init` creates the .git directory. The .git directory contains all the data that git needs. The .git directory contains objects, refs/heads, refs/tags subdirectories and template files.

> [Note]
>
> It is safe to run `git init` in an existing repository.

## clone
**`git clone`** clones a repository from the remote repository.
