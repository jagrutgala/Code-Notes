# Git

Git is a open-source distributed version control tool. It is designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is used for tracking changes in the source code of a software project, managing different versions (or `snapshots`) of the code, and collaborating with other developers.

With Git, developers can work simultaneously on the same project without causing conflicts and track the history of the changes made to the code.

**Version Control**

A `version control system (VCS)` is a software tool that tracks and manages changes to the source code of a software project over time.

Some other Version Control systems other than Git are :

- [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
- [Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)
